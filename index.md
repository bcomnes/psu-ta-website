# Bret Comnes

Hi, you have found my PSU website.  I am a graduate PhD student in the physics department.  I also have a personal website located at [bret.io](http://www.bret.io/).

## Currently:

I am working at [PSU's OIT ARC](http://www.pdx.edu/arc/academic-and-research-computing) for the summer.  I can also be found in and around SRTC at times. 

## Classes I TA:
*   None this summer :(  Hopefully the fall.

## Office Hours
*   None this summer :( But let me know if you need to meet up for any reason.
