# Bret Comnes

Hi, you have found my PSU website.  I am a graduate student in the physics department.

## Currently:

I am a TA for the Winter Semester teaching an undergraduate physics lab and grading lots of tests.

I am involved with [PSU's OIT ARC](http://www.pdx.edu/arc/academic-and-research-computing) located in FAB90 where I get to install software, help users with their projects, manage and build research systems, learn about and build computer clusters and answer email.  

I can also be found in and around SRTC at times.  

## Classes I TA:
*  Physics Lab section F1:  11:00-1:50 PM SRTC 113

## Office Hours
*   Monday 10:30 - 11:30 PM SRTC B1-56

## Projects
* I am putting a scanning electron microscope in the [Nano Development Lab at PSU](http://www.pdx.edu/nano-development-lab/) online using webRTC.  [Check out the project page!](http://bret.io/pages/projects/semterface)
