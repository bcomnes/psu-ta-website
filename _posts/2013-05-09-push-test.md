I think I managed to get [PuSH](https://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/) working tonight [following this guide](http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/01/02/enabling-pubsubhubbub-for-github-hosted-blogs.html).  Let's see how well it works.  

Also, [aaronpk](http://aaronparecki.com/) helped me get set up with [Webmentions](http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention) using [Pingback.me](http://pingback.me/), so now technically links to this website can now announce themselves and will be politely forwarded there.  It will be nice to see that GH-Pages can participate with these [indiweb](http://indiewebcamp.com/Main_Page) developments.
