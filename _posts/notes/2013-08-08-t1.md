Please divert your attention to a great post by [Shane Becker](http://iamshane.com/):

- [JSON-LD is an Unneeded Spec](http://iamshane.com/articles/2013/8/8/1/json-ld-is-an-uneeded-spec)

It isn't that JSON-LD, and its efforts to standardize a JSON vocabulary, lacks valuable motivation or isn't trying to solve a real problem.  The problem is that it's a *redundant* effort to [existing standards](http://microformats.org) and it is making a lot of the *same mistakes* of standards past.

I was bummed to hear that [Payswarm](https://payswarm.com) is partially behind it, as they are trying to tackle an important issue.  Did the microformat vocabulary not meet their needs for backend database vocabulary?
