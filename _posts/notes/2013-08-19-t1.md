Two feed readers that interest me:

- [Go Read](http://www.goread.io)
- [TTRSS](http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki)

Still using [fever](http://feedafever.com) + [reeder](http://reederapp.com).  Reeder is really decent, but I don't like the development model or the other sync backends.  I want to like [news blur](http://www.newsblur.com) but it is so slow.  Fever is the definition of a passive income project.  Development on it is completely dead, it's full of bugs and does not even support things like [PuSH](http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/).
