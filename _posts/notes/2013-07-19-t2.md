Okay, now that this appears to work, any feed readers reading this feed should now get all new posts within 5 seconds of publishing.  Hopefully when Github-pages gets a post page build hook implemented, the delay generator using [URLReq](http://ivanzuzak.info/urlreq/) will no longer be needed, but it's a decent work around for now.

This is also going to act as a second test because I blew the last test by having the wrong post commit hook URL initially.  Yay for [pubsubhubbub](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5kHx0rGkec)!
