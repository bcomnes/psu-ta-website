Continued testing ARC's software list on Centos 6 today.  Giving up on [crosstool-ng](http://crosstool-ng.org) for now, even though GCC 4.6+ built successfully.  That tool is more involved than initially promised.

Continued setting up the replacement computer in Erik's lab.  The [python interface](https://github.com/ggledhill/SEMterface) is up and running, so the next step is to show that it can be operated over VNC.  Looked into [webRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/faq#TOC-Video) video capabilities and things look promising with the use of WebM. 

Things needed:

- Working PS2 keyboard
- VGA cable
- Free/Open source VNC client
