# Jekyll Onward

Where were we?  Jekyll had been loosely decided upon, but I was on shaky ground in terms of my Unix skills, and had literally no HTML or CSS understanding and I didn't know ruby.  So what did I do?  This was sill, but I decided to dive in and see what I could come up with.

##  The first Attempt

My first attempt, I literally just tried to get Jekyll up and running using the page structure.  This didn't work that well as I ran into many problems just getting the site to compile.  Yes, it was my fault, but when Jekyll does not compile right, it does not tell you why really. 

I finally was able to get *something* running, but all I could manage was a simple landing page.  No blogging features, completely un-styled.

##  Jekyll Bootstrap

After running into my ignorance on the topic rather hard in the first attempt with Jekyll, I decided to back out of my strategy of just diving in head first and look around at some other examples first.  I sure did manage to find quite a few examples I liked, but none were well documented and left me with more questions than I began with.

Then I found Jekyll Boostrap, well, two of them.
