The time has come to change domains.  Please update your bookmarks and feed readers soon, as the domain expires mid July, 2013.

Keeping an eye on the [.tc pricing debacle](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/08/adamsnames-advises-extraordinary-price-increase-for-tc-registrations-and-other-changes-to-gd-vg-doma.html) over the last year, it has become clear that the `.tc` TLD should be thrown into a pile close to the pile that `.ly` currently lives in (Read: you should not trust the `.tc` domain unless you have very specific reasons to do so).  

My prior domain, [bre.tc](http://bre.tc), which was originally bought and registered for a year somewhere around the price of $40-50, would cost me $119 to renew through my preferred registrar [Iwantmyname](http://iwantmyname.com).  This is simply unaffordable.

It turns out that the new TLD registrar for .tc, Meridian TLD, is very clearly strong-arming domain owners to transfer their domains to the companies in house domain service and renew for a year for the cost of $40, with a yearly rate of $70 thereafter.  More can be read about this untrustworthy TLD on the [iwantmyname.com blog](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/08/3-easy-steps-to-ruin-the-reputation-of-a-countrys-domain-extension.html).
